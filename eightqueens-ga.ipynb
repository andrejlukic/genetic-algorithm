    "The [Eight Queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) is a famous puzzle that has been studied extensively in- and outside of computer science. It was first published in the chess magazine _Schach_ in 1848. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be formulated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "_\"Place 8 queens on a regular (8x8) chess board such that no queen attacks any other queen.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "A queen in the game of chess can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The puzzle can be solved by hand (and even [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) studied it back in 1850)."
